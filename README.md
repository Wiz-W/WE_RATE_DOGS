# WE_RATE_DOGS
The dataset that I PERSONALLY   wrangled (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.  WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.


Project Steps Overview
Tasks carried out in this project are as follows:

Step 1: Gathering data from 3 different sources as follows:
      a.Directly download the WeRateDogs Twitter archive data (twitter_archive_enhanced.csv)
      
      b.Use the Requests library to download the tweet image prediction (image_predictions.tsv)
      
      c.Use the Tweepy library to query additional data via the Twitter API (tweet_json.txt) **but twitter developer account wasn't approved,so i went with an alternative** 
      

Step 2: Assessing data

Step 3: Cleaning data

Step 4: Storing data

Step 5: Analyzing, and visualizing data

Step 6: Reporting
